# CIMPLE-Seq: Exploring Chemical-Genetic Interactions in *Burkholderia cenocepacia* K56-2

This repository contains the data analysis scripts and a Shiny web application developed to explore the chemical-genetic interaction profiles of *Burkholderia cenocepacia* K56-2 essential gene knockdown mutants. The interaction profiles were generated using the **CIMPLE-Seq** (CRISPRi-based Interaction Mapping via Pooled Library Enrichment Sequencing) approach.

## ðŸ§ª Project Summary

- CRISPRi was used to systematically knock down essential genes in *B. cenocepacia* K56-2.
- Mutant pools were screened against ~5000 compounds.
- CIMPLE-Seq was used to quantify mutant abundance post-treatment and compute **chemical-genetic interaction profiles (CGIPs)**.
- These CGIPs reveal mechanistic insights into compound action and essential gene function.
